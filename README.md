# 1. Rcodes_paper folder contains all the R codes for the simulated results presented in the paper
# Within the Rcodes_paper folder:
# FMP-ANOVA_decomposition.R computes the FMP decomposition on FTS to decompose it into deterministic and time-varying components.
# FM-ANOVA_decomposition.R computes the FM decomposition on FTS to decompose it into deterministic and time-varying components.
# Point_forecasting.R Computes the point  forecasts to the functional residuals obtained from FMP-ANOVA.
# Point_forecasting_FANOVA.R Computes the point  forecasts to the functional residuals obtained from  FM-ANOVA.
# Compute_coverages.R Computes the coverage probability as well as the interval score for the interval forecasts. 
# Naive_point_forecasts.R computes the naive point forecasts based on independence.
# Plots_mortality. Produces the rainbow plots for the case of US, France, Japan.
# Boxplots_pointforecsts.R Computes boxplots for the point forecasts. 
# Boxplots_intervalforecsts.R Computes boxplots for the interval  forecasts.
# 2. datasets. Contains all the datasets.
