# 1. Rcodes_paper folder contains all the R codes for the simulated results presented in the paper 
"Forecasting high-dimensional functional time series: Application to sub-national age-specific mortality"

# Within the Rcodes_paper folder:
# FMP-ANOVA.R computes the FMP decomposition on FTS to decompose it into deterministic and time-varying components.
# FM-ANOVA.R computes the FM decomposition on FTS to decompose it into deterministic and time-varying components.
# New_Point_forecasting.R computes the point  forecasts to the functional residuals obtained from FMP-ANOVA and FM-ANOVA.
# Compute_coverages.R computes the coverage probability as well as the interval score for the interval forecasts. 
# Naive_point_forecasts.R computes the naive point forecasts based on independence.
# Plots_mortality. Produces the rainbow plots for the US.
# Figure_1.R to Figure_6.R They are the R codes to generate the plots 1 to 6 in the paper.  
# 2. datasets. Contains all the datasets.
# 3. Folders Results_Figure_2 to Results_Figure_6. Contains the simulation results for those figures.
# 4. Within the folder shiny app, there is all the R code to generate the shiny app.
